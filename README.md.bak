### overview
crab-go is a very simple go restful web framework   

crab-go is based on [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo)   

The inspiration comes from my previous PHP framework [crab](https://github.com/allenhaozi/crab)

It also contains thoughts on a typical Web Restful interface architecture,   

We can also incorporate some accumulated experience into this framework, and abstract out reusable capabilities.   

Avoid building wheels repeatedly  

The purpose of this framework is to give you the last mile of effective advice for creating a PaaS service management   

More often, you want it to be a methodology that includes design patterns
